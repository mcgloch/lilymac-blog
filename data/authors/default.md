Lily Mac is an Irish designer working in England. As I've been working remotely for over a year now it's made me reflect on where I want to live and how. My goal is to work remotely from Ireland.

In order to do that while still maintaining my love of design, I've set up this website to share my thoughts on design systems, Figma, project management and organisation. 

Knowledge is power.
